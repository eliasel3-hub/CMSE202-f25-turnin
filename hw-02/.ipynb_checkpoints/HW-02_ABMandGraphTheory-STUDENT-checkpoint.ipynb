All cells should be dead except those with coordinates (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), and (1, 9). Run the simulation and show that your glider advances from the top left to the lower right, retaining the same configuration. How many timesteps does it take for the glider to reach the lower right with the same shape as the initial glider? Set the total number of timesteps to this number."

    "**<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> From the simulation results, we observe that intermediate probabilities, around p = 0.3 to 0.4, tend to maintain the highest fraction of alive cells throughout the simulation. Very low probabilities, such as p = 0.0 or 0.1, result in too few cells to sustain life, causing many to die from underpopulation. Conversely, very high probabilities, like p = 0.5 or 0.6, lead to overcrowding, which causes many cells to die from overpopulation. This behavior aligns with the rules of Conway’s Game of Life, which favor a balance: cells require some neighbors to survive but too many neighbors result in death. Not all curves tend to zero; for intermediate probabilities, the fraction of alive cells often stabilizes at a nonzero value due to the formation of stable patterns (still lifes)  and oscillators. In contrast, boards with very low or very high initial probabilities may quickly drop to zero because of underpopulation or overpopulation. Thus, whether the fraction of alive cells goes to zero depends on the initial density and the emergence of stable configurations during the simulation.**"
