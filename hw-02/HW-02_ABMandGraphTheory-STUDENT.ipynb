Very low probabilities, such as p = 0.0 or 0.1, result in too few cells to sustain life, causing many to die from underpopulation. Conversely, very high probabilities, like p = 0.5 or 0.6, lead to overcrowding, which causes many cells to die from overpopulation. This behavior aligns with the rules of Conway’s Game of Life, which favor a balance: cells require some neighbors to survive but too many neighbors result in death. Not all curves tend to zero; for intermediate probabilities, the fraction of alive cells often stabilizes at a nonzero value due to the formation of stable patterns (still lifes) and oscillators. In contrast, boards with very low or very high initial probabilities may quickly drop to zero because of underpopulation or overpopulation. Thus, whether the fraction of alive cells goes to zero depends on the initial density and the emergence of stable configurations during the simulation.**"
